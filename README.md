## Launchpad
A program written in Visual Basic that allows you to play your keyboard like a Novation Launchpad.

# Features
It uses the letters and numbers of your keyboard to play sounds.
It uses the numpad to change the pages that are 8.
It allows multi-sampling (maximum of 10, still in development).
It allows you to replay the sounds if you've committed an error.

With your help maybe we can make longer this list.
